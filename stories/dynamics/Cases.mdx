# Overlapping cases resolution

Dynamic problem are mainly two:

- Resolve collisions (overlapping)
- Gravity

Both processes are triggered by the dynamics.

Overlapping is solved by using priority, but sometimes it is difficult to
understand the different cases we can face, here are some of them.

## Cases

All the cases are faced by normal items (black) and the pushed item (red). The
pushed item will always has a priority of `Infinity`.

### Overlapping between two items

The pushed item collide with the other two items and will be pushed down.

<SVGLayout layout={[
  {x: 0, y: 0, w: 2, h: 2, i: '1', f: [{}, {}, { y: 3 }, { y: 2 }] },
  {x: 2, y: 1, w: 2, h: 2, i: '2', p: Infinity, f: [{}, { x: 1 }, {}, { y: 0 }] },
  {x: 0, y: 2, w: 2, h: 2, i: '3', f: [{}, {}, { y: 5 }, { y: 4 }] },
]} />

### Push elements with a gap over

<SVGLayout layout={[
  {x: 0, y: 0, w: 3, h: 2, i: 1, f: [{}, {}, { y: 5 }]},
  {x: 3, y: 0, w: 1, h: 5, i: 2, p: Infinity, f: [{}, {x: 2}] },
  {x: 1, y: 2, w: 2, h: 2, i: 3, f: [{}, {}, { y: 7 }]},
  {x: 0, y: 5, w: 5, h: 1, i: 4, f: [{}, {}, {}, { y: 9 }]},
]} />

## Caveats

As we are pushing `support trees` some holes could be filled with other elements
but not pushed as one would expect, in the next example we could see that the
item `5` will be pushed by the `support tree` based on the item `1` and the take
the first empty place:

<SVGLayout layout={[
  {x: 1, y: 0, w: 2, h: 1, i: '1', f: [{}, {}, { y: 4 }] },
  {x: 0, y: 1, w: 2, h: 1, i: '2', f: [{}, {}, { y: 5 }] },
  {x: 1, y: 2, w: 2, h: 1, i: '3', f: [{}, {}, { y: 6 }] },
  {x: 3, y: 0, w: 2, h: 4, i: '4', p: Infinity, f: [{}, { x: 2 }] },
  {x: 2, y: 4, w: 2, h: 1, i: '5', f: [{}, {}, {}, { y: 5 }] },
]} />

## Glossary

- __Priority:__ One item is prioritized to get more relevance to others on
  overlapping resolution, the dragged element will have always `Infinity`
  priority
- __Support tree:__ Is a list of items that are supported by one item, so we will
  say the support tree of an item, for example: if we have several items one
  upon another an we said the support tree of the base element we are
  referencing the list of all elements support by this element and recursively
  until a gap or empty space
- __Gap:__ A gap is defined as an empty space between two items
- __Occupation matrix:__ Is a representation of the items layout using a grid and
  setting the id on each coordinates that are occupied by this item, in blank
  space are `null` values, for example:
  ```
  W1,   W1,   W1,   null, null
  W1,   W1,   W1,   null, null
  null, null, W2,   W2,   null
  null, null, W2,   W2,   null
  ```
